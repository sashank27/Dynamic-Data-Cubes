# Dynamic Data Cubes

Dynamic Data Cubes is a hybrid data structure capable of storing Gaia Tycho data. You can read more about Gaia Tycho data here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho-2_Catalogue. Gaia archive is available for download here - https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/

# Data Cleaning

The raw data available at Gaia Archive was processed to obtain 3 dmensional coordinates of every star (using galactic latitude, longitude and parallax), with the Sun as centre (Galactic Coordinate System). The folder `dataset` contains the processed files. For every star, we have stored the parameters HIP, Tycho2_ID, X_Coordinate, Y_Coordinate and Z_Coordinate in the processed files. You may read more about the parameters here - https://gaia.esac.esa.int/documentation/GDR1/datamodel

# Data Structure

The logical structure can be seen as a large matrix made up of several small matrices (called cubes from this point onwards). The cubes are not all identical, they have different side lengths, which would be described shortly. Each cube holds zero or more stars. Each cube spans a certain area in space and contains the data of all stars that lie within its region. The coordinates of Sun are (0, 0, 0).

It is observed from the 3D coordinates, that about 50% of stars are nearer to the Sun, within 2000 light year radius. About 90% of the total stars are within 8000 light year radius and the rest are scattered. Using uniform cubes would result in varying star density per cube, hence this gives the motivation to design a large matrix with cubes inside, but not of uniform sides. The matrix is of size 65536 * 65536 * 65536 (all units in light years) with the sun as centre. There are 3 types of cubes that constitute the entire matrix.

* Type 1 - Cube side - 256 light years - present uptill 2048 light years from the centre on all sides. 
* Type 2 - Cube side - 1024 light years - present uptill 8192 light years from the centre on all sides.
* Type 3 - Cube side - 4096 light years - present uptill 32768 light years from the centre on all sides.

The average density of stars in a cube (stars / cube) comes down to a little over 100 with this design. The highest number of stars present in any cube is a little over 10000. More than a hundred cubes are empty.

The data structure can be visualized as a graph with cubes being its nodes. As a result, there are edges from a cube to its neighbours. We store, for every cube, its neighbours (may be greater than 26 too due to non uniform cubes). The implementation can be found in the C++ file - `DataCube.cpp`. Running this file outputs the required data to create the data structure in several files. These files are present in the folder `Data` star_0.csv, star_1.csv, ....., star_20.csv contain star information - their location (3 dimensional coordinates) and the information about which cube they belong to (We recognize each cube by its bottom-leftmost point).

# Queries

We support 2 types of queries currently. 

Query Type 1: Given any point in space in 3 dimensional form, the data structure is capable of determining efficiently the stars (and the star count) present in the corresponding cube and the neighbouring cubes. 

Query Type 2: Given any point in space in 3 dimensional form, the data structure is capable of determining efficiently the stars that lie within a radius 'k' from the queried point.

The naive method of traversing the entire dataset takes about 1.5 seconds on a average, whereas the Dynamic Data Cubes can answer the same query in less than 0.1 seconds. At worst cases, the times taken by both the methods in the same, but Dynamic Data Cubes return results faster on average cases.

# User Interface

We provide the user to query the Gaia Tycho data stored in Dynamic Data Cubes via a web application. Below are the details of the user interface:

* Back-End Technologies: Python Django
* Front-End Technologies: HTML, CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript

# Credits

Dynamic Data Cubes has made use of data from the European Space Agency (ESA) mission Gaia (https://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia), processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC, https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dpac/consortium). Funding for the DPAC has been provided by national institutions, in particular the institutions participating in the Gaia Multilateral Agreement.

# Future Work - Finding a spiral arm of the galaxy

In addition to storing the neighbours and the stars in the cube, we may also store the number of stars in each cube. Hence, from any random point in 3D space, if we keep moving towards high density neighbours until we find a local maxima, we MAY BE able to find a spiral arm of the galaxy and the peaks.
